Possible design of gpm2:

   gpm2-starter:
      - reads configuration
      - starts daemons
         * first gpm2-daemon
      - connects daemons
         * connects them through stdin and stdout?
            - perhaps a job of gpm2-daemon?
         * stderr is relayed to the log console
            - which can log to syslog

   gpm2-daemon:
      - main daemon
      - starts mice handlers
      - listens for ipc
      - relays input data abstracted to clients
      - does *NOT* draw a cursor or something like that
      - can be used by x.org (see below)
      - should be portable

   gpm2-cdisplay:
      - Console DISPLAYS: displays mouse cursor on console
      - reads input from gpm2-daemon
      - reads mouse information
      - perhaps os-specific versions

   gpm2-ccandp:
      - Console Copy AND Paste daemon
      - reads input from gpm2-daemon
      - copies selected text into own buffer
      - pastes buffer to console
      - perhaps os-specific versions

   gpm2-xorg:
      - interface between gpm2 and x.org
      - could make mouse support unecessary in x.org
      - should be portable

   gpm2-syslog:
      - connects to the gpm2-daemon logging port
      - reads messages
      - relays them to syslog

Configuration:
   /etc/gpm2/
      mice/
         default/
            mice-userid:   userid of person reading/writing mice devices
            mice-groupid:  groupid of person reading/writing mice devices

         <name>/
            device:     link or device to use
            protocol:   one line, containing protocol
            opts:       options for that protocol
            userid:     overwrites default/mice-userid
            groupid:    overwrites default/mice-groupid

      clients/
